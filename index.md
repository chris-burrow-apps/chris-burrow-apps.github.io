## About me
I am hard-working, organised and accustomed to meeting deadlines. I have an eye for accuracy and detail, have a good memory and am quick to learn new techniques and procedures. I work great in a team and am also able to work independently on projects.

I now have almost 11 years experience on both Android and iOS (large and small scale applications), I am open to job opportunities that challenge me in which I can learn to excel, and build a successful long career with. Before I started with mobile application development, I spent a great deal of my life working with computers. I am familiar with both software and hardware, and had to repair a great deal of them.
