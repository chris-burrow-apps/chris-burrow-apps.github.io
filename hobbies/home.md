## Did any of my work help you out?

## <a name="3d-printing"/> CAD / 3D Printing - Chris3DPrintsStuff

![Example 3D Print](/images/hobbies/outdoor-camera-cover.webp)

I have been doing CAD for 16 years. 
First got my interest for it in High School and then once 3D Printing appeared on the scene at a cheaper price, I jumped at the oppertunity and then started playing with CAM. Originally I printed models for friends, family for random gifts and interesting ideas. Over COVID I donated face masks & ear helpers to local businesses and even the local hospital (120+ shields & 100+ ear helpers).

</p>

<p>From 2023, I started publishing my designs for free on Printables for other people to give feedback and use.</p>

<p>From 2025, I created my own listing pages with the name "Chris3DPrintsStuff", selling some of those designs/models to the public as physical prints: iOT Covers, Car Repair, Home DIY, Gaming Accessories, etc. I have now sold over 150 orders with over 30 5 star reviews selling a range of designs.</p>

## <a name="home-assistant"/> Home Assistant

![Home Assistant Example](/images/hobbies/home_assistant.png)

Quirk of being a developer, I love making things automated. This includes my house! I have setup automations for:

* Notify when washing / drying is finished.
* Notifying me of recycling collection on my phone.
* Setting up projector with screen and surround sound by just saying 'Enable Film mode'
* Making my dumb rf driveway gates smart.
* DIY House Alarm

I have been working with Home Assistant for around 10 years for my own home/friends/family.
Now setting up my families caravan to be automated too for less than half the price companies would sell you one for! (updates to come)

I have now started creating some blueprints that can be added to Home Assistant to extend its functionality

## <a name="immich-kiosk"/> Immich Kiosk Mode

While converting my Google Hubs to no longer use Google Photos. I discovered an app called [Immich](https://immich.app/).
This is a community driven application that basically looks and acts like Google Photos but being able to host locally.

![Immich Homepage](/images/hobbies/immich-homepage.jpg)

The learning curve I had to work out was how to display those images within a nice pretty wrapper. Which is how I then started testing Beta builds for [immich-kiosk](https://github.com/damongolding/immich-kiosk)

![Immich Kiosk Example](/images/hobbies/immich-kiosk-fullscreen.jpg)

Immich-Kiosk is so nice to use; can be behind a password, add fade to your photos, time/date, so different images on different frames and so on. To help contribute, I have been going through requests and when people ask to check a build, I have been doing so and contributing my own ideas on how to improve it.

[https://github.com/damongolding/immich-kiosk/discussions/95#discussioncomment-10835550](https://github.com/damongolding/immich-kiosk/discussions/95#discussioncomment-10835550)

The only limitation I saw now was how to get from Immich-Kiosk to Google Home Hub. Blueprints was the only way I could see this working while making it simple for new users.
See my steps in this repo:

## <a name="local-tuya"/> Converting Cloud devices to local

![Tuya Cloudcutter Device](/images/hobbies/tuya_cloudcutter.jpg)

One of my bug bares with IOT devices is that most are tied to the cloud.
I have started to contribute towards a Open Source project where I contribute configurations of devices that was once tied with Tuya and now can be controlled locally.
