The main language I use is **Kotlin** as in my spare time I develop **Android** Applications and have started to publish them for free to the **Google Play Store** with adverts within them. I also have  previous experience in **iOS** development using a wide range of APIs and languages such as **Coredata**, **Cocoapods**, **Objective C** and **Swift** for both iPhone & iPad.

Apart from when I am creating mobile apps, I like to play both PC & Console games as well as look into Virtual Reality applications. I also enjoy doing adrenaline activities, such as go-karting, paintballing and in the past I have progressed in training to be a qualified skydiver.
