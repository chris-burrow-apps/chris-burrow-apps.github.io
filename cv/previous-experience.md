## June 2013 – May 2017 – Degree 53, Manchester
While working with Degree 53, I worked on a wide range of Android & iOS applications spanning from gambling applications, charities to pre school learning. Due to the different scales of projects, this has helped me learn how to work in various team sizes which involved sprints with the agile work pattern. I have submitted many new and updated apps to the app store for this company such as Betfred Lotto, Football Scores, Ready For School and Racing Results. I also integrated new technologies into a wide range of apps such as Touch ID, Apple Watch, Apple Pay, PingIt, Android Wear and Bluetooth Beacons. Due to my knowledge of both Android & iOS, I have been technical lead in larger projects and also been involved in the design stages suggesting what each platform should and should not do.

## February 2012 – March 2013 – Great Fridays, Manchester

While I was working for this company I worked on IOS applications for a range of clients. One of the applications I worked on was the Gucci Style fashion application. While working with this company, this me experience in the field and learn different styles of coding to suit the clients needs. 

I also had to follow strict deadlines and had to continuously change designs that needed to be met; pixel perfect. This meant restructuring my code and changing animations and UX design to make the applications.

## April 2006 – Temporary work – Advance UK, Leigh

Work experience for one week, within education time. My main roles were to be a member of the computer technician team and to work on the shop floor, giving advice to customers and noting down the repair problems.  

First of all, when on the front desk, I had to note down the problems the customer was having, estimate the solutions and identify on how long the repair may take. A couple of times, customers asked me for advice such as, which software do I think would be needed to do a certain task or what type/make of motherboard I would recommend. Once I familiarised myself with the task I was given the opportunity to work with the computer technicians. 

I was assigned computers with multiple problems such as, the equipment wouldn't turn on, had a virus, registry problems; so had to use problem solving skills to identify and fix different types of problems. One day, the network malfunctioned, so I was assigned the task of getting it up and running again. The network was a LAN and had a server at source. I was familiar with this type of connection and had it up and running again by using series of commands. I am glad I was given the opportunity to do this work experience as it gave me an insight into how a small computer company worked and helped me improve my time keeping and problem solving skills. 

## April 2006 – Temporary work – Westleigh High School

Work experience for one week, within education time. I was employed by the school to design and create a new website for the science department and improve the overall design of the main website.

I had to use time management to complete the project within the designated time period I was given.

Within that time period I had to learn HTML, interview the staff for features they would like to request, gather all the documents that they wanted web based and create the website. I had to self start and get familiar with the server and the new web upload system so I could test the website. Each day I had to self motivate and use problem solving skills to get round some issues with the features they wanted to implement, as well as the structure of the website and how it was going to be laid out.  Once the task was completed, I showed the teachers to demonstrate how I followed the specification, as well as features that it contained. They suggested improvements which I implemented in the final completed design. I then had to become familiar with the FTP to upload the design to the main server. 

This work gave me experience to help with my self motivation, problem solving skills and allowed me to learn a new way of completing a task.
