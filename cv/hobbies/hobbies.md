In my spare time I am involved in quite a few bits:

## CAD / 3D Printing
Mixed for my own enjoyment, helping out friends and family. I have been doing CAD since I was 16. Making designs for scratch, adapting existing designs and then 3D Print the prototype. Over COVID I also donated face masks & ear helpers to local businesses and even the local hospital. 

## Home Assistant
Quirk of being a developer, I love making things automated. This includes my house! I have setup automations for: 
* Notify when washing / drying is finished.
* Notifying me of recycling collection on my phone. 
* Setting up projector with screen and surroundsound by just saying 'Enable Film mode'
* Making my dumb rf driveway gates smart. 
* DIY House Alarm

Now setting up my families caravan to be automated too for less than half the price companies would sell you one for! 

## Converting Cloud devices to local
One of my bug bares with IOT devices is that most are tied to the cloud. I have started to contribute towards a Open Source project where I contribute configurations of devices that was once tied with Tuya and now can be controlled locally.
