In my own time I have been developing my own apps to publish on Google Play

## 3D Print Organiser
3D Print Management App (Android) – Inventory, quoting, and order management system for 3D printing companies. 
Built for real-world business use and publishing on Google Play.
This is built using Android Studio with Native Kotlin support. 
To aid development, I have built this along side Gemini to speed up building screens, tests and design work.


### Tools used:
* Android Studio
* Gemini AI agent helper
* [Code Magic CI/CD](https://codemagic.io/)
